- Uses SQL (structured Query Language) for queries
- Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server

2. NoSQL Databases:

- Types:

1. Document Based: MongoDB, CouchDB
2. Key value stores: Redis, DynamoDB
3. Column-Family stores: Cassandra, HBase
4. Graph Databases: Neo4j

3. NewSQL Databases:

- Combines relational models with NoSQL scalability.
- Examples: CockroachDB, Google Spanner.

Popular Databases in the Market:

1. Relational Databases (SQL-Based):

- PostgreSQL: Open sournce, advanced RDBMS with robust features like ACID compliance, complex queries and scalability
-MySQL: Widely used open source RDBMS, popular in web apps.
-SQLite: Lightweight and embedded RDBMS for smaller apps.

2. NoSQL Databases:

-MongoDB: AA document oriented NoSQL database, ideal for unstructured data
-Cassandra: High availability and fault tolerance for massive datasets
- Redis: In-memory key-value store for caching and real time apps

3. NewSQL and Modern Databases:

-CockroachDB: SQL-based, highly scalable, distributed database.
-Prisma (ORM tool): Not a database but a modern ORM for managing PostgreSQL, MySQL and other dbs
